2. Project Details

- Project 1

Exceptional details about the most amazing project that someone most possibly could have ever done when they can barely wrap their minds around JS _HERE_

- Project 2

Another impressive project here. One can only imagine what's next to come if this is what the second project looks like.

- Project 3

An exceptional project where one can see the exactly when the individual ascended into the limbo of greatness.

- Project 4

This project was about so and so. Coming into it, it seemed like reinventing the wheel. Looking at it now, the worlds surprised we ever used the previous obsolete pathetic wheel.

- Project 5

It's not the Mona Lisa, but it's something. Project 5 takes Elon Musk's Nueral link network and connects it to Spotify... IN A PIG! Now that little piggy will be shaking to the beat.
